# Project 4

## Purpose:
The purpose of this lab was to use REST API server code, and testing the code modules accordingly. With the outputs, I was expected to test it within Postman to make sure it worked.

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- Postman
- Non-web server Node.js
- REST API
- JSON
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to use Postman to test code modules. I also learned how to use REST API that works with a data source, and code GET handles accordingly.
